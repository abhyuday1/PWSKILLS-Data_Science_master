    "#### GET Method: \n",
    "   1. The GET method is primarily used to request data from a specified resource. It is used when we want to retrieve information from the server without causing any side effects on the server's data. \n",
    "   2. the data is typically included in the URL as query parameters. These parameters are visible in the URL\n",
    "   3. They are generally considered safe, as they don't modify server data\n",
    "     \n",
    "#### POST Method:\n",
    " 1.  The POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource. It is used when we want to send data to the server for processing, which can include updating server-side data.\n",
    " 2.  the data is sent in the request body, not in the URL. This allows for the transmission of larger amounts of data and more complex data structures.\n",
    " 3. They are used for actions that modify server data, such as submitting forms, creating new records, or making updates."
