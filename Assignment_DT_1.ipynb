    "\n",
    "Decision Making Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At the beginning, the entire dataset is considered, and the algorithm selects the feature that best separates the data into distinct classes. This feature becomes the root node of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The dataset is then split into subsets based on the values of the chosen feature. Each subset represents a branch from the root node.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The process is repeated for each subset. The algorithm selects the best feature to split each subset further, creating child nodes."

    "\n",
    "The geometric intuition behind decision tree classification involves the creation of a series of decision boundaries in the feature space that partition the data into different regions corresponding to different classes. Each decision boundary is aligned with one of the features, and the recursive nature of the decision tree builds a hierarchical structure of regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each decision node in the tree represents a decision boundary in the feature space. The decision is based on a particular feature, and instances are split into two subsets according to the feature's values.\n",
    "2. At each decision node, the feature is used to create a binary split. If the feature is continuous, the decision boundary is a threshold value.\n",
    "3.  it forms a hierarchical structure where each level corresponds to a decision based on a specific feature. The leaves of the tree represent the final decision regions or classes.\n",
    "4. The decision boundaries created by the tree are orthogonal to the axes of the feature space. \n",
    "5. Each leaf node represents a region in the feature space, and the majority class or a probability distribution of classes in that region is assigned as the predicted class.\n",
    "6. While individual decision boundaries are linear (since they are aligned with feature axes), the combination of multiple decision boundaries allows decision trees to capture complex nonlinear relationships in the data."
