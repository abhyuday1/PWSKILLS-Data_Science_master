    "\n",
    "- Grid Search CV (Cross-Validation) is a technique used in machine learning for hyperparameter tuning. The purpose of Grid Search CV is to systematically search through a predefined set of hyperparameters to find the combination that results in the best model performance.\n",

    "--Here's how Grid Search CV works:\n",
    "--\n",
    "1. Define the Hyperparameter Space: we specify a set of hyperparameters and their possible values that we want to tune. \n",
    "2. Define a Scoring Metric: we also specify a scoring metric, which is used to evaluate the model's performance for each combination of hyperparameters. \n",
    "3. Create a Grid: Grid Search CV creates a grid of all possible combinations of hyperparameters.\n",
    "4. Cross-Validation: The dataset is split into multiple subsets or folds. Grid Search CV performs cross-validation on each combination of hyperparameters.\n",
    "5. Scoring and Selection: After each cross-validation run, the model's performance is evaluated using the specified scoring metric. \n",
    "6. Select the Best Combination: Once all combinations have been evaluated, Grid Search CV selects the combination of hyperparameters that yielded the best performance on average across all cross-validation folds."
