    "## Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Ridge regression is a regularized linear regression technique used in machine learning and statistics. It is designed to address some of the limitations linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ridge regression is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the OLS regression cost function. This penalty term discourages large coefficients, effectively shrinking them toward zero. The addition of this penalty term is known as L2 regularization, and it helps prevent overfitting and multicollinearity in regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "--Differences between Ridge Regression and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression:\n",
    "--\n",
    "1. Regularization:\n",
    "Ridge adds an L2 regularization term to the cost function, which encourages coefficients to be small but not exactly zero. whereas  OLS does not include any regularization, meaning it can lead to overfitting when there are many predictors or multicollinearity issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Preventing Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge helps prevent overfitting by shrinking coefficients, making the model more robust to noise and variations in the data.whereas OLS can be prone to overfitting when the model is too complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    " Ridge can effectively handle multicollinearity, where independent variables are highly correlated, by reducing the impact of correlated predictors on the model.whereas OLS can produce unstable coefficient estimates when multicollinearity is present."
