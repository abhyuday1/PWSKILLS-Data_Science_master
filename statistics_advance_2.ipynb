    "A PMF is used to describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It gives the probability of the random variable assuming each of its possible values. In other words, it maps each possible value of the random variable to its corresponding probability.\n",

    "Mathematically for discrete Random Variable X PMF is P(X=x)\n",
    "x is specific value and satisfies the following properties:-\n",
    "1. P(X=x) >=0 for all possible values of x.\n",
    "2. summation of P(X=x)=1, where sum is taken over all possible vaues of X.\n",

    "A PDF is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. Unlike the PMF, which deals with discrete values, the PDF deals with continuous values.\n",

    " \n",
    " In this case, the PDF provides the likelihood of an individual's height falling within a specific range. For example, it can tell us the probability of selecting an individual with a height between 160 cm and 170 cm from the population.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. It allows to find the probability that a random variable falls within a particular range, which is useful for understanding the likelihood of various events occurring.\n",
