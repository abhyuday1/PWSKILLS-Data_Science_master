    "## 1. what is multithreading in python? why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python\n",

    "--Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single Python process. Each thread represents a separate flow of control, allowing program to perform multiple tasks concurrently, or in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses:-\n",
    "Multithreading is often used for I/O-bound tasks where threads spend a significant amount of time waiting for input/output operations to complete, such as web scraping, network requests, or reading/writing files. It is not as effective for CPU-bound tasks that require intense computation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "1. Faster Execution: For compute-intensive tasks that can be parallelized, multithreading can lead to faster execution by utilizing multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "2. Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process can share data and memory.\n",
    "3. Efficient Resource Utilization: In situations where tasks are I/O-bound (e.g., waiting for user input, reading/writing files, or making network requests), multithreading can efficiently utilize system resources by allowing other threads to execute while some are waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:-\n",
    "1. Complexity: Multithreading introduces complexity to a program. Managing threads, coordinating their execution can be error-prone and challenging to debug.\n",
    "2. Difficulty in Debugging: Debugging multithreaded programs can be more challenging than single-threaded ones."

    "\n",
    "Deadlocks:- A deadlock is a situation in which two or more threads or processes are unable to proceed because they are  waiting for the eachother(s) to release a resource. In a deadlock, the involved threads or processes are effectively stuck, and the program cannot make any progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Condition:-\n",
    "A race condition is a situation in concurrent programming where the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing or order of execution of multiple threads or processes. In other words, the outcome of a program becomes unpredictable because it depends on which thread or process executes its code first."
